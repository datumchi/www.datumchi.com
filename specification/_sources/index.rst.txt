The DatumChi Protocol is a suite of rules based on cryptographic techniques common with many "Blockchain" platforms, but without the unnecessary complexity and uselessness of magical internet money, with a focus on solving real problems with data sharing between participants while maintaining privacy, coupled with an attestation-based identity model.

This documentation covers the protocol, as well as a set of Reference Implementations and Protocol Tests.
